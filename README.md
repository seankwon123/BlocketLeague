### What is Blocket League?
Blocket League incorporates the fun of Rocket League into a web3 game built in Unity with Unique Network NFTs to authenticate users and transactions.

### Description
Legacy versions of car soccer use the same boring car models for every game. While some aspects are customizable, there is no marketplace to sell or trade earned items to other players. Blocket League allows users to mint, level up, and trade the NFT cars used to play the game. The game was developed in Unity for single player, but could eventually be developed to support local multiplayer. The player uses keys to tilt the car clockwise and counterclockwise, as well as double jump. The players compete to be the first to score 3 goals. 
The NFT minting integration is handled through Unique Networks.
### Future State
Play to earn by leveling up dynamic NFT’s and selling them. Eventually creators could be given the tools to make their own user generated designs for cars or Nested NFT parts. The market could be filled with user generated collectible artwork. All vehicles could house dynamic attributes such as goals scored, saves, win streak, and number of previous owners which may impact the market price. These changes would contribute to a more enjoyable experience for both creative and competitive players. The shared history is the major advantage of using Polkadot blockchain. Global history of all matches, transactions, achievements paves the way for a public decentralized market within the game to emerge.

### Technical Description
First time users must authenticate by minting an account token with Unique. This uses the create account method to establish an authenticated user. The Unity game is exported as Webgl into javascript which connects to the Unique Network on Polkadot’s parachain to mint and transfer as requested.
